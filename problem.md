Here all the problem I face !

20/05: Binding the items of a category to its own category. In that way when I'm working with items I can't find its parents easily by doing a research. 

My solution : I want to give to each item of a category something that tells them to which category they belong to. 

21/05: I did some changing to try fix a function and now when adding a todo it's adding the previous one to the current item.

22/05 : Problem : When we supress a category we need to also supress its item from the dom.
